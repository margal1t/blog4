			Steamed or seared, the delicious dumplings at this East Village Chinese make for a super cheap, cash-only snack that's handmade right in front of you many prefer to stuff themselves on the run since the premises aren't much to look at.</p>
			<p>Review 2:
			The food was AMAZING! The service was pretty quick even though they were so full and the prices are  extremely fair for what you get. Big portions and did I mention AMAZING FOOD!</p>

			<p>Review 1:
			We loved everything about our evening at Ivan Ramen---the rich variety of appetizers (go for the pickles and the chicken!), the permission to slurp, the spicy and the not so spicy ramen dishes, and the nice selection of beers and hard ciders. Fun, irreverent, delicious---a great way to dine with family or friends.</p>
			<p>Review 2:
			Saw Ivan Ramen on Chefs table and it was everything I‚Äôd expected! Delicious, hit every spot.
			We had pork buns to start which were incredible, buns were lovely and soft and the pork was cooked perfectly.
			The ramen..... gorgeous. Tried a couple of different Ramens, both were different in flavour but equally delicious. Definitely the best Ramen I‚Äôve had so far!</p>

			<p>Review 1:
			I just need to take a second to appreciate HOWWWW GOOD THE CHICKEN SANDWICH IS. Literally everything about it from the potato bun to the actual chicken, to the pickles and the pickle butter spread. I got the koreano, where the radish added a nice little crunch to it. The fries I ordered were seasoned to perfection and just so damn good.</p>
			<p>Review 2:
			I've been a die hard Momofuku fan since my first summer in NYC four years ago and it is no surprise that Fuku (its fast casual diner) also knocks it out of the park.

			The service at the East Village shop was friendly and very quick. My piping hot spicy chicken sandwich was in front of me less than 5 minutes after ordering. The breading on the fried chicken was exquisite and the chicken filet was honestly what made a seemingly simple looking sandwich out of this world. </p>
